A Pilot Study on Tele-rehabilitation for Whiplash-Associated Disorders

Research repository for a pilot study on tele-rehabilitation interventions for Whiplash-Associated Disorders (WAD). This repository contains the source code for the manuscript, including statistical data summaries and bibliography.

📄 Abstract

Background: Whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) frequently cause persistent pain and dizziness, contributing to disability. Although physiotherapy interventions show promise, access remains limited.
Objective: This pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a combined balance and cervical strengthening program delivered remotely.
Methodology: Fourteen participants (mean age 27 ± 2.3 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. The intervention comprised an eight-week home-based program using a hybrid model of live online sessions and pre-recorded videos.

📊 Key Findings

Balance Improvement: The experimental group demonstrated significant improvement in Berg Balance Scale (BBS) scores ($p < 0.001$) compared to the control group.

Feasibility: The hybrid tele-rehabilitation model (live supervision + independent video training) proved feasible with high adherence among young adults.

Symptom Severity: No significant changes were observed in Quebec Task Force (QTF) classification scores, likely due to the mild baseline symptomatology of the cohort.
